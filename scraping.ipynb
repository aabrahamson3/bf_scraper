As such, this round of dry hopping should certainly be added to the primary midway through fermentation.Personally, I recommend adding both sets of dry hops to the primary fermenter. No need to secondary. Though, if you are kegging, you could consider adding the second round of dry hops in the keg.Good luck and happy brewing! Let us know how it turns out!',\n",

Add the first round of dry hops on Day 3 of fermentation, add the second round on Day 6, rack to the keg on Day 8 and force carb. through Day 10. This is somewhat extreme, but doable. The carbonation won't be 100%. So, the beer will benefit from additional time in the keg.It would be my strong recommendation to not secondary this beer, especially if you are eventually kegging it. Clarity certainly isn't where this beer shines. And the additional 3 days or so sitting on the yeast and initial dry hop matter shouldn't negatively impact the beer. O2 is this beer's worst enemy. So the transfer to a secondary and, then, to the keg, adds a step that I suggest avoiding. IMO, the only negative consequence to skipping the secondary is that you might transfer more hop material and yeast to when racking directly to the keg. But that should all drop to the bottom of the keg as it chills and carbonates, only to be purged when you pour you first pint or two. Just my two cents...Good luck and happy brewing!

Clarity certainly isn't where this beer shines. And the additional 3 days or so sitting on the yeast and initial dry hop matter shouldn't negatively impact the beer. O2 is this beer's worst enemy. So the transfer to a secondary and, then, to the keg, adds a step that I suggest avoiding. IMO, the only negative consequence to skipping the secondary is that you might transfer more hop material and yeast to when racking directly to the keg. But that should all drop to the bottom of the keg as it chills and carbonates, only to be purged when you pour you first pint or two. Just my two cents...Good luck and happy brewing! Let us know how it turns out!\",\n",

The closest I can find is not close at all, like a Cara Ruby or I can get a Crystal but it's the 60L. Could I just skip this ingredient all together or do you have any other suggestions? I've looked up some alternatives and the suggestions that come up I also can't get.\",\n",
       "  \"MoDouglas - I think you are fine to just skip it altogether and dial up the 2-row to 80% (i.e., 11 lbs. for this batch size) to make up for the loss in points. I tend to shy away from anything Crystal/Cara in these types of hoppy beers. The resulting beer will be just a tad lighter in color. So, if you really wanted to, you could consider small amounts of Munich or Victory to fill the gap. But the hops, yeast and water profile are what make this beer shine. So, I'd just say keep it simple and skip it. Good luck and let us know how it turns out! Very cool to know this beer is being brewed in South America!\",\n",

In my experience the hop bitterness is very restrained from whirlpool additions made at the 150-170 F range.@Pikk - Sorry for the delay if you have already brewed this. But the intent was for you to cool to 170 F, stop the cooling, add the whirlpool hops and gently stir here and there over the course of 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, continue to cool down to pitching temp and transfer to the fermenter.@mlatner - It sounds like the LAIII yeast are doing their thing. This yeast comes in strong and finishes the job pretty quickly, in my experience. And it is very forgiving if you don't have the ability to control ferm. temps. The 1.072 is a bit higher than I tend to start with. I don't know if your efficiency was well below 70% and/or your wort volume was lesser due to boil off, etc., but your beer should be fine. You may finish a little bit higher in the .14 - .16 range. But just rely on your hydrometer to tell you when the yeast are done. Let me know how it turns out!@danlatimer - I'm sorry for your disappointment. Not sure if you are kegging or bottling. But I will say that given the significance of the hop bill, a lot of hop matter falls to the bottom of the keg. So, your first few pints could have a higher concentration of this material which contributes to a pronounced bitterness. This bitterness is a bit different from your normal IPA bitterness and tends to hit the back of the throat. Hopefully with a little more cold conditioning, time, and pints poured, your beer comes around a bit. If so, please let me know. I hope it works out!\",\n",
